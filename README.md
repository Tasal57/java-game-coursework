Project Title

Java 2D Physics-Based Platformer Game

Overview

This project is a 2D game developed in Java as part of a university coursework module.
The game uses a physics engine to simulate gravity, collisions, and movement.
Players navigate through levels, avoid obstacles, and interact with game objects.
